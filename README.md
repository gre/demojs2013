A demo compo made from scratch in about 10 hours at [demojs2013](http://demojs.org) by [@greweb](http://twitter.com/greweb).

Tech
---
Only pure web technologies. Tested on Chrome / Firefox.

* [Canvas2D](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/) for drawing everything.
* [WebGL GLSL](http://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/) for post-processing.
* [glsl.js](http://github.com/gre/glsl.js), a lib I've written to simply the usage of a WebGL shader as a post-processing effect.

Audio
---

**SunVox** has been used for making the entire sound (no external samples, all with modular synths from the crickets to the man breath).

You'll find the track on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/greweb/demojs2013).

Notes
---

More than 50% of my time was dedicated to making the audio in SunVox, 40% was for making the intro and the outro, which remains 10% for the middle of the demo, this is why this part is still basic and unfinished. That is ok for 10 hours, I've choosen to focus on the music and the mood :)
